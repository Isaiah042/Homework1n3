    //The Benefits of Unit Testing
/*
Test is just code
Create a test class
It does a targeted code (Tests: Class, method or function)
Checks to see if the results are correct (Inputs put that are put in)
Can test code before the whole code is built and done
Helps makes sure things a running before letting people access it
Also helps with design making it easier to understand
Builds confidence
Lastly its used for documentation
 */
//Writing More Complex tests
    /*
    Go to java doc for methods about class assertions
    Go to github gettingstartedjunit5 to learn

Applying Assertions:
    You can click on the error to take you where the problems at
    AssertSame - will verify that two variables being compared are the exact same object in memory
    assertNotName - verify an object thats supposed to be copied isn't the same instance as the original
    assertTrue - checks to see if the test will return true
    assertFalse- checks to see if the test will return false
    assertIterableEquals - returns a series of objects for use in a for loop

Setting up and Tearing Down Tests:
    @BeforeAll - Will run before running all the other methods in the test class
    @BeforeEach - Will run before each method has been tested
    @AfterEach - Will run after a new method is tested (Run after EACH method)
    @AfterAll - Will run after ALL test methods a ran
    After All and BeforeAll are static but can be overwritten
